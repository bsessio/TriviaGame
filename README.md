# Marvel Cinematic Universe Trivia Game

I challenge you to a game of **Marvel Cinematic Universe Trivia**! You will find 15 questions inside, challenging even the most masterful MCU buff.

## Instructions
Once on the opening page, just click "Click to Begin" and see if you have what it takes!

You have 30 seconds to answer a question. Once you've selected a question, it will tell you whether you were wrong or correct, and then after a few seconds, move on to the next question.

If curious how well you're doing, a score tracker will appear in the top left of your screen!

At any time, you can click 'Do Not Know' to accept a loss on a question and just move on, without the added shame of a big red 'Wrong'!

And if you ever want, you can restart the game with an easy button click.

Once you get to the end, you can always try again and see if you can remember enough to get a perfect score!
